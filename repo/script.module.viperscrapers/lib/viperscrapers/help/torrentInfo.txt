With a bit of testing the top providers for results are set for the Defaults while the remaining providers are used as backup.
Currently, Torrentio and the Elfhosted scrapers yield the best results.

A setting in some add-ons is used to control when disabled providers are used. If no results are found on the enabled sources, the add-on will automatically check ALL providers regardless of them being disabled in the settings. This allows you to keep a minimum number of providers enabled, resulting in quicker scrapes and results.

Only the best are chosen for the defaults to help increase scraping speed. The less work the add-on has to do to find sources, the faster the scraping process will be. Getting 100 results is a waste as you will never need that many.
The only reason you would want to manually switch on other providers would be for unique content like Anime or a TV show that only pulls from a source that isn't on by default. Switching that on would help avoid a full rescrape every time you watched that specific series.
